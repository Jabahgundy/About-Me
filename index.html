            Hey, again my name is Jabah Gundy, and you all can call me Jay for short. <br> 
            I was born and raised in the Bronx, New York City. Growing up there, <br>
            some days was perfect, and some were rough. In a nutshell, I had to become a man early. <br> 
            Ultimately, I am glad I had the opportunity to move to a different state, <br> 
            which helped me slow down and focus on what I wanted for myself.<br></p>

            One day I was watching a movie about a guy who mistakingly creates a <br> 
            program with the intent of helping law enforcement stop crime. However, <br> 
            the program came to life and began to terrorize the city. Long story short, <br> 
            the program was deleted, and the city was saved. That is when I fell in <br>
            love with computers. I wanted to know more about computers, so I joined <br>
            the military to jumpstart my career and became a 25 Bravo Information <br> 
            Technology Specialist. Now, I am here studying how to code. <br>  
            Thank you for reading! <br></p>
